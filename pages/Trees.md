- Variant: Binary Search Tree
	- a tree sorted with values sorted in such a way to allow Binary searches to occur

- Based on [[Complexity Analysis]]
	- For a Tree, what is the time complexity of finding a value in the tree #card
	  card-last-interval:: 4
	  card-repeats:: 1
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.6
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-03-01T18:41:57.755Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-02-25T18:41:57.756Z
	  card-last-score:: 5
		- O(n)
	- For a Binary Search tree, what is the time complexity of finding a value in the tree #card
		- O(log n) if the tree is balanced (fairly even branch distribution)
		- O(n) if the tree is unbalanced (only a few long branches)
